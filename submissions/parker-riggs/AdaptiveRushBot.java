/**
 * AdaptiveRushBot picks between three scripted rush strategies each game and
 * tries to counter whatever the opponent is building. The three options are
 * RangedRush (long-range units that excel on larger maps), LightRush (cheap
 * fast combat units), and HeavyRush (slower but tankier units that beat Light
 * in direct fights).
 *
 * Strategy selection works in two layers. First it asks a local LLM (Ollama)
 * for a recommendation based on a compact summary of the game state. If the LLM
 * is unavailable, times out, or gives an unrecognizable answer, the bot falls
 * back to a hand-written counter-strategy heuristic so it always has something
 * reasonable to do regardless of whether Ollama is running.
 *
 * The general counter triangle is: Light beats Ranged (closes gap quickly),
 * Heavy beats Light, Ranged counters Heavy (kiting from distance).

     * 1. If we already built heavy units, keep going with HeavyRush. Switching

     *
     * 2. Same for light units -- if the barracks is already producing Light,

     *
     * 3. If the enemy has Light units on the field, switch to HeavyRush because
     *    Heavy wins that direct combat decisively.
     *
     * 4. If the enemy has Heavy units on the field, Light is not a great answer
     *    but it is faster than Worker and at least applies pressure.
     *
     * 5. If the enemy appears to be running a pure worker swarm with no dedicated
     *    military, LightRush shreds workers very efficiently.
     *
     * 6. If enemy attackers are already close to our base we pick LightRush
     *    for the fastest possible military response.
     *
     * 7. Once we have enough workers to sustain economy we stop spamming workers
     *    and switch to military. On large maps prefer RangedRush for range advantage.
     *
     * 8. Past the time threshold for this map size we commit to a military
     *    strategy whether anything else triggered or not.
     *
     * 9. Default to LightRush. It is a safe opener against any unknown opponent.
